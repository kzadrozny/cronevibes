## Built With
Used the [Start Bootstrap - Grayscale](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) template for easy deployment and so I can focus on the content. [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

This is a personal website with content I write and it not open to contribution.


## Start Bootstrap Template Usage
The part of the documentation is from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) to remind me of the helper tasks written into this template.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
